This Lab is devoted to the study of the basic sorting algorithms(start by the slows ones), which include the
>  **Bubble Sort**
>  **Insertion Sort**
>  **Selection sort**.

Further more, it is devoted (again) to the study of the sorting algorithms; we will now move to the fast ones, which include the
